TO DO:
Chat screen: switch from QTextEdit to a Layout with labels and pixmaps, easier to implement the ACK things
include more fields in the sending stream, for example ue_from(sender) (important)
ability to update m_online_users<const UE&> list everytime a user changes port, easier to redirect messages from server
investigate sockets behavior
