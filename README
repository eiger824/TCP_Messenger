1) mkdir build && cd build
2) cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path_to_project/build/cmake_targets ..
3) make install
4) additionally a script can be created in the build directory which automatically calls both generated terminals, something like this (in a file called run.sh with chmod =rwx run.sh)
   ./cmake_targets/client -d -u eiger824 &
   ./cmake_targets/server -d &

ENJOY :)
